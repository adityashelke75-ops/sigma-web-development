            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I am a second-year Electronics and Computer Engineering student with a strong passion for web development and modern technologies. I enjoy designing and developing visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly websites that deliver a smooth and engaging user experience across all devices.

I am constantly learning and experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to improve my frontend development skills and create clean, structured, and efficient web interfaces. I believe that good design is not just about appearance, but also about usability, performance, and accessibility.

Currently, I am actively seeking internship opportunities where I can apply my technical knowledge, gain real-world experience, and grow as a frontend developer while contributing to meaningful projects and innovative digital solutions.

    <h3>About College</h3>
    <p>
        I am currently a second-year student at Zeal College of Engineering and Research, 
        pursuing a degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering. My college has provided 
        me with a strong foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, 
        allowing me to explore my interests in web development, electronics projects, 
        and programming. Being part of this institution has not only enhanced my technical 
        abilities but also encouraged me to develop problem-solving, teamwork, and project 
        management skills, which I actively apply in my personal projects and internship 
        experiences.
